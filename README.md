# cortical_thickness_img_re
The goal of this experiment is to develop an algorithm to estimate cortical thickness map from a raw T1-weighted image. In this experiment I will combine diffeomorphic registration based cortical thickness (DiReCT) measure with Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTS) and DL+DiReCT, a tool combines a deep learning-based neuroanatomy segmentation and cortex parcellation with a diffeomorphic registration technique to measure cortical thickness from T1w MRI.
